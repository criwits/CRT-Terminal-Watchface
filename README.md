# CRT Terminal Watchface for Mi Band 6

This watchface is available [here](https://amazfitwatchfaces.com/mi-band-6/view/4381).

This is a simple digital watchface, only showing time (hour & minute), date, steps, pulse rate and battery level on the screen.

This design was inspired by traditional old-style CRT terminal. The colours, cyan and yellow, are picked from traditional IBM-like PC, so as the font selected -- For the clock part IBM Plex Sans (license: OFL) is used, while for other text I chose PxPlus IBM VGA8 (license: Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International), the font adapted from old IBM PCs.

I made this watchface for my pesonal use, so I would probably not add more features to it, sorry.
This repository, on the contrary, holds all the design assets for you to modify on your own (may need Inkscape to edit SVGs and MiBandWatchFaces to build the watch face, and you need to install 2 fonts mentioned above).

The directory `Project` holds the project for [MiBandWatchFaces](https://github.com/Johnson070/MiBand-5-watchface-editor/releases).
Open `miband.json` to edit the project.
And the directory `SVG assets` holds my design plots, including building the CRT-like digits and background, measuring basic geometry coordinates.
